# :star:  Automation Exercise API Automated Testing

This project contains automated tests for the APIs of the Automation Exercise website. The tests were originally written using Postman, and the goal is to migrate them to Cypress for better maintainability and scalability.

## :pencil2: Description

The repository includes a Postman collection that tests various API endpoints for the Automation Exercise website. The tests focus on verifying the functionality of key features such as user authentication, product listing, and order creation. This automated testing helps ensure that the API responses are correct and consistent.

### API Testing Features
- :key: **User Authentication**: Test login functionality and verify token generation.
- :package: **Product Retrieval**: Test if product data is returned correctly from the API.
- :shopping_cart: **Order Creation**: Test the ability to place orders and check if orders are created properly.
